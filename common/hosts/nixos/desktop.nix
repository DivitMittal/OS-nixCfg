# This lives in common/hosts/nixos (applied to every nixos host, including WSL and the ISOs),
# so it is gated to the hosts that actually run the graphical session. Today that is only L2 —
# the sole host with a graphical home-manager config (see home/default.nix). WSL/M1 home
# configs are tty-only and T2/AS have no graphical home config, so a greeter there would be
# broken. Add a host to this list when it gains a graphical home config.
